/**
 * Polygram-side display constraints injected into every chat's system
 * prompt. This is INFRASTRUCTURE knowledge — the agent's business
 * logic shouldn't have to know that Telegram's `<pre>` block on a
 * portrait iPhone wraps at ~36 monospace chars. The agent decides
 * *what* to render; polygram tells it *how* the surface displays.
 *
 * Why a polygram concern, not an agent concern:
 *   - Same agent runs across surfaces (Telegram bot, CLI, future
 *     surfaces). Each has its own width / markdown / image support.
 *   - Mixing display rules into agent prompts means every agent doc
 *     has to be updated when Telegram's rendering changes (or when
 *     we onboard a new chat surface). Centralising here keeps
 *     `_shumabit-base.md` and friends focused on business logic.
 *   - Tested in isolation; no risk of agent drift breaking tables.
 *
 * Width budget — measured 2026-04-30 from production screenshots:
 *   - iPhone portrait, default Telegram font: ~36 monospace chars
 *     per line in a `<pre>` block before wrap.
 *   - iPhone landscape: ~70.
 *   - Desktop client (macOS, default): ~85+.
 * Agents see the conservative number (40) so output stays clean on
 * the smallest reasonable surface.
